# dotnet-core

Here‚Äôs my collection of self-educational samples on [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). When I make the claim that I am interested in .NET during a job interview, I am taking responsibility for the samples explored here.

## my .NET responsibilities

The samples in this repo can be divided into three top-level categories:

1. ASP.NET interests
2. interest in the .NET Generic Host [üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host)]
3. dabbling in various cross-platform UI solutions

### ASP.NET interests

My ASP.NET interests start with [a minimalist example of serving static files](./dotnet-web-static-content). Then, I graduate to [the content negotiation features](./dotnet-web-mvc-content-negotiation) of ASP.NET MVC. After my graduation, I move to the fundamental subject of validation in ASP.NET:

- [unobtrusive validation](./dotnet-web-mvc-unobtrusive-validation) in ASP.NET MVC
- [full-stack validation](./dotnet-web-mvc-validation) in  ASP.NET MVC

My study of ASP.NET culminates to [an exploration of Angular Forms over ASP.NET](./dotnet-web-mvc-angular-forms), a rather large thing that is hard to keep current.

My [Azure Functions sample](./dotnet-azure-functions-quickstart) is just my way to play around with ‚Äúserverless‚Äù ASP.NET. My [minimalist Entity Framework sample](./dotnet-ef-core-in-memory) is here as a reminder that ASP.NET and EF often work together!

### interest in the .NET Generic Host

There is one sample dedicated to the .NET Generic Host [üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host)]. I also tack on [a benchmarking sample](./dotnet-benchmark) for collecting performance metrics on this command-line level.

Finally, I am imagining that the .NET Generic Host need a little tiny HTTP server of its own‚Äîso I have [a little EmbedIO sample](./dotnet-web-embedio).

### dabbling in various cross-platform UI solutions

Here are the UI solutions I play around with (in order of importance to me):

1. [Bolero](./dotnet-web-bolero)
2. [Avalonia](./dotnet-avalonia) (also, [an F# implementation without XAML](./dotnet-avalonia-func-ui))
3. [Blazor](./dotnet-web-blazor)
4. [Fable](./dotnet-web-fable)
5. [Electron.NET](./dotnet-electron-net)
6. [Photino](./dotnet-photino)

## searching for `dotnet new` templates

The [`dotnet new` templates site](http://dotnetnew.azurewebsites.net/) allows us to search for templates.
