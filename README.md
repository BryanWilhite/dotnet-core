# dotnet-core

Hereâ€™s my collection of self-educational samples on [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (not just called _.NET_). The intention here is to address these concerns:

- Playing with .NET features and/or projects.
- Migrating to Entity Framework Core.
- Migrating ASP.NET Web API to ASP.NET Core.
- Using F# as alternative to TypeScript perhaps with [Giraffe](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe) or [WebSharper](https://developers.websharper.com/docs) ([Fable](http://fable.io/), by the way, is happily married to React).

## searching for `dotnet new` templates

The [dotnet templates site](http://dotnetnew.azurewebsites.net/) allows us to search for templates.
