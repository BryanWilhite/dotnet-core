# dotnet-core

Hereâ€™s my collection of self-educational samples on [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (not just called _.NET_). The intention here is to address these concerns:

- Playing with .NET features and/or projects.
- Playing with Entity Framework Core.
- Playing with ASP.NET Core.
- Playing with ASP.NET Core, using F# with Giraffe [[GitHub](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/giraffe)].
- Playing with F# as an alternative to TypeScript with [Fable](http://fable.io/) (no longer happily married to React by default).
- Playing with F# as an alternative to C# in Blazor [[GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Components/WebAssembly)] with Bolero [[GitHub](https://github.com/fsbolero/bolero)].

## searching for `dotnet new` templates

The [dotnet templates site](http://dotnetnew.azurewebsites.net/) allows us to search for templates.
