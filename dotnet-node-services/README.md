# ASP.NET Core and Node Services

This sample highlights the pre-rendering capabilities of ASP.NET core with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices` [[nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices/)] and `aspnet-prerendering` [[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspnet-prerendering)].

## serving static pages from ASP.NET Core

This sample runs because ASP.NET was configured to serve static pages.
