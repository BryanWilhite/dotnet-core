# ASP.NET MVC validation with jQuery AJAX

This folder contains the various ways [ASP.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_Core) supports validation with jQuery AJAX. This represents my public recognition that jQuery [[GitHub](https://github.com/jquery)] (by the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/)) _still_ plays a default role in the surfacing of .NET validation solutions to the the Web. Since the turn of the century, jQuery has been accompanied by:

- jQuery Validation by J√∂rn Zaefferer
- jQuery Unobtrusive Validation [[GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-validation-unobtrusive#jquery-unobtrusive-validation)] by the .NET Foundation

## historical jQuery validation articles

These historical jQuery validation articles may select the background which might be relevant to ASP.NET (Core) in the .NET 6 time frame:

- Document unobtrusive validation #1111 [[GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/1111)]
- `jquery-ajax-unobtrusive` documentation [[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50148838/22944) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15977785/22944)] (see ‚Äú[Unobtrusive validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation?view=aspnetcore-6.0#unobtrusive-validation)‚Äù)
- ‚Äú[Setting up jQuery Unobtrusive Validation](https://www.mobzystems.com/blog/setting-up-jquery-unobtrusive-validation/)‚Äù
- ‚Äú[Applying unobtrusive jquery validation to dynamic content in ASP.Net MVC](https://xhalent.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/applying-unobtrusive-validation-to-dynamic-content/)‚Äù
- ‚Äú[ASP.NET MVC 3 unobtrusive jQuery client-side validation with child collections](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7015526/asp-net-mvc-3-unobtrusive-jquery-client-side-validation-with-child-collections)‚Äù

The first links in the list above are suggesting that StackOverflow is being used as a documentation location for jQuery validation technologies which I will perpetually find unusual.

### the most important bits from the links above

Once jQuery validation files are ‚Äòwired up‚Äô (which is conventionally done by referencing the partial, `Views/Shared/_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml`, generated via `dotnet new mvc`), we activate client-side validation by adding the following attribute to the `form` element: `data-ajax=true`.

What remains is the application of the attributes used for ‚Äúunobtrusive‚Äù validation. My work here will show that it can be done auto-magically by Microsoft ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù or declared in markup manually by hand (see ‚Äúthree approaches to validation with jQuery AJAX‚Äù below).

### there is no `System.Web.Mvc.Ajax` in the world of .NET Core

The `System.Web.Mvc.Ajax` namespace contained helpers like `AjaxExtensions.BeginForm` [üìñ [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.ajax.ajaxextensions.beginform?view=aspnet-mvc-5.2)] which might be carried around in the `MicrosoftMvcAjax.Mvc5` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MicrosoftMvcAjax.Mvc5/). I assume this work is not continued and not intended for the world of .NET Core because of the dependency on jQuery libraries‚Äîand jQuery itself has been regarded as a legacy technology for over a decade. A relatively recent article on this subject is ‚Äú[ASP.NET MVC 5 - Razor AJAX Form Control](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/asp-net-mvc5-razor-ajax-form-control/).‚Äù

## three approaches to validation with jQuery AJAX

I have here three approaches to validation with jQuery AJAX:

1. declaring in markup manually by hand and `Html.EditorFor`
2. using `Html.EditorFor` and Data Annotations
3. repeating #2 with FluentValidation [[GitHub](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation)] instead of Data Annotations

## sample set up

From the `dotnet-web-mvc-validation/` [directory](../dotnet-web-mvc-validation):

```bash
dotnet new sln -n Songhay.Validation
```

For approach #1:

```bash
dotnet new mvc -o Songhay.ValidationWithMarkup.Web

dotnet sln Songhay.Validation.sln \
      add Songhay.ValidationWithMarkup.Web/Songhay.ValidationWithMarkup.Web.csproj
```

For approach #2:

```bash
dotnet new mvc -o Songhay.ValidationWithAnnotations.Web

dotnet sln Songhay.Validation.sln \
      add Songhay.ValidationWithAnnotations.Web/Songhay.ValidationWithAnnotations.Web.csproj
```

For approach #3:

```bash
dotnet new mvc -o Songhay.FluentValidation.Web

dotnet sln Songhay.Validation.sln \
      add Songhay.FluentValidation.Web/Songhay.FluentValidation.Web.csproj
```

All three approaches will use the same, famous models: a `TodoList` which contains a list of `TodoItem`.

## `Html.EditorFor` and `Html.PartialAsync`

Because we are using a `TodoList` which contains a list of `TodoItem` we _must_ use `Html.EditorFor` which can be considered a perceived performance loss because we effectively _must_ load a potentially large Web page _synchronously_, losing the benefits of `Html.PartialAsync`. This list of `TodoItem` is a _child_ collection that must be indexed in order to meet validation conventions. ‚Äú[Collection Editing with MVC](https://www.abstractmethod.co.uk/blog/2017/12/collection-editing-with-mvc/)‚Äù details these conventions.

When it is possible to use `Html.PartialAsync`, the caveat here is to avoid using markup like this:

```html
<div asp-validation-summary="All" class="text-danger"></div>
```

My work is showing me that we should prefer the following instead:

```csharp
@Html.ValidationSummary(false, "", new { @class = "text-danger" })
```

Additionally, we should prefer using `@Html.ValidationMessage` [üìñ [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.html.validationextensions.validationmessage?view=aspnet-mvc-5.2)] or `@Html.ValidationMessageFor` [üìñ [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.html.validationextensions.validationmessagefor?view=aspnet-mvc-5.2)] over this:

```html
<span asp-validation-for="Name" class="text-danger"></span>
```

These preferences of mine should be considered when the HTML declared inside a partial is ignored by jQuery validation.
