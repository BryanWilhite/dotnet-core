# Fable on .NET Core

This sample is a snapshot of the `dotnet new` template for a “simple” Fable app.

From an elevated Powershell prompt we start with:

```ps1
dotnet new -i Fable.Template
```

Then we generate the project:

```ps1
dotnet new fable -o Songhay.FableOne
```

This command will generate a [README file](./Songhay.FableOne/README.md) that supplements this one.
