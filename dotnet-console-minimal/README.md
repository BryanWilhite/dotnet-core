# .NET Core console app, minimal

## `dotnet new console -o hwapp`

Microsoft introduces .NET Core to us through its `dotnet new console` (which is the Console Application template you can see in the output of `dotnet new`). For more detail, see “[Tutorial: Create a .NET console application using Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code).”

I have also included the F# version of the `hwapp` in the [`hwapp-fsharp`](./hwapp-fsharp) directory with this command (from the parent directory):

```bash
dotnet new console -o hwapp-fsharp -lang F#
```
